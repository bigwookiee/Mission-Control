Expo Presentation: Communications
Presentation Notes

Slide: Communication Designs
	- On the left is the basic overview for how our communications work.
		- Packet from home computer -> home arduino -> xBee modules ->
			-> drone arduino and vice versa
	- On the right is the design for how mission plan uploads will work
		- Send start install packet
		- Wait for ACK
		- While instructions still need to be sent:
			- Send instruction (Drone will store instruction)
			- Wait for ACK
		- Send end install packet
		- Drone sends back ACK 
			- (Future work: include md5 checksum of mission file to verify integrity)
			
	
Slide: 	Communication Packet Types
	- Table of planned packet types needed for project. All have a specific
	  type that corresponds to a specifc service that will be running on the drone.
		- When the drone sees a packet of a certain type, it knows to pass it to a specifc service
			- Example: Takeoff packet received, goes to takeoff service, service parses and sends command to drone
			
			
Slide: Services (Fully Implemented)
	- List of drone specific services we have implemented into our comms system
		- Can talk about what some of the services do
		
Slide: Future Services Required
	- List of drone specific services that still need to be implemented
		- Mission plan system needs to be integrated
		- Can talk about how Heartbeat service will send drone status info back to home arduino and feed GUI info
