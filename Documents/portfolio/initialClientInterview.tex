\subsection{Meetings}
We will be having weekly meetings in Brandon's office on Thursdays at 3:30 PM. These meeting will include status updates, further work on designs, troubleshooting, and assignment of tasks

\subsection{End Goal}
To have a stable and flying quadcopter that can be communicated with remotely. In addition, work done on a flight planning software (including GUI) should be underway. The project will be done in small steps, as this project requires research and development throughout.

\subsection{First Steps}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Learn how quadcopter works
		\item Reconstruct quadcopter to be stable 
		\item Learn how to fly quadcopter
		\item Understand flight computer documentation
		\item Design communications
		\item Be sure to use xAPI
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Functional quadcopter (stable)
		\item Documentation of quadcopter construction
		\item Use of xAPI on arduino communication system
		\item Communication system using xBEE to communicate from computer to quadcopter
		\item Ability to send commands to quadcopter
		\item Flight planning software, including GUI
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Other Notes}
Other notes from the meeting included aviation terminology, how to pair the remote control and quadcopter receiver, quick tour of controller and motor adjustments, and a quick tour of flight computer.
